# Areas of Study that will help a person effectively build applications with the Frigate Forms System.

Frigate Forms is designed to make delivering highly interactive [RIA (Rich Internet Applications)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2551058/rich-internet-applications.html).  It provides  complex forms based systems easy and 10X faster than if they were built using traditional frameworks.   It is also designed to make it possible for people who are not full time programmers to build and customize forms without expensive high engineering talent.    Some basic skills that will make it much easier for people to use the system quickly.

Our goal is for a well  person to be able to invest less than 5 days of self study and become productive producing new high quality,  highly interactive Web Forms using the Frigate Forms system.       The tutorials below should allow most motivated non-programmers to reach proficiency in a few days even if they do not have a programming background.

Our [programmers guide](programmers-guide.md)  and [Getting Started guide](gettings-started.md) May be adequate to for most people with some web programming exposure or  who learned HTML and CSS in highschool.  Luckily there are  good free tutorials that can help everybody else get up to speed quickly.

### Study Aids for Absolute Newbie.

* [What is a Rich Internet Application (RIA)](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2551058/rich-internet-applications.html) - Frigate Forms delivers a RIA style application that makes it fast and easy to deliver complex multi-page forms that work together to deliver a pleasing user experience. 
* [Khan Academy - Introduction to  HTML](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-html/v/making-webpages-intro) -  When using Frigate Forms you it will write most of the HTML for you but it is still helpful to understand the basics because you may need to look at what was generated to help customize the look and feel page with CSS. 
* [Khan Academy - Introduction to CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics) -  CSS allows us to control the Look and feel of how a Web Page will be rendered.   Frigate Forms supplies some basic formatting that may be adequate for many applications but most users will want to use CSS to customize these forms to meet their own visual taste.    Frigate Forms uses CSS as a way to allow applications to be designed in a common way but still deliver highly customized user experiences.  Pay particular attention to Selecting by ID and Selecting by Class because this is how you will specify what you want changed. 
* [w3 school html Div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.ASP) - In HTML a Div is a container that can contain other HTML elements.  We heavily use HTML Div.  Frigate Forms uses a technique where a Div may be created empty and filled with content latter.   
* [yaml tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/yaml/index.htm)  - The screens, forms and widgets defined and used by Frigate Forms use a language called YAML.   It is a human friendly way to represent metadata that is still easy to for computers to parse.   A more complete tutorial is available on udemy for free. [Udemy YAML Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course/yaml-essentials/) 

* [JSON Tutorial](https://beginnersbook.com/2015/04/json-tutorial/)  - Frigate Forms typically interacts with web services to provide to show in forms and to send data that has been edited back to the [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server).  We also use a notion called data_context that places data edited into JSON data objects.    You will need to know how to read and understand JSON data structures.
* [TSV Tab Delimited Tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) -  Many services or files used by Frigate Forms if they are not in YAML or JSON format will be in a Tab Delimited format.  You will need to be able to read and produce these files.  
* [What is a Web Service](https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-web-service)  The Web browser interacts with the [servers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server) to retrieve and save data.  In some instances this uses functionality built into standard web servers but in many cases we need a Web service to take data supplied by the user,  validate it and save it in a form that is useful latter.   Web services are also commonly used to provide smart pages such as search results  and customized shopping experiences.     Frigate forms provides a basic [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) that has some functionality to save and retrieve data but it is also compatible with any web server.
* [URI & HTTP Basics](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_requests.htm)  Frigate Forms runs mostly in the browser but it is only useful when interacting with web servers that provide data to display and then save data once it has been edited.    The primary mechanisms controlling this interaction are HTTP Requests that use URI.    Note.  When you display a form in Frigate Forms it makes a HTTP request to fetch the definition for that form from the server.  [wiki URI  defenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)
* [Using Chrome Debugger to understand CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript)  When developing applications using Frigate Forms you will eventually need to customize [how it displays the form using CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css).    In many cases the easiest way to figure out the CSS selectors is by [inspecting what has been rendered](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-styles) using a Web browser debugger.  Luckily a free debugger is built into almost every desktop browser.
